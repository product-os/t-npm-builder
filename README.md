# NPM Builder Transformer

This transformer will take in a `type-product-os-t-node-module-source` contract and build it into a `type-product-os-t-node-module`. It will copy contents into the output folder, and run `npm run build`. The result is a fully copy of the source code with the build output found in the original `type-product-os-t-node-module-source` contract's backflow.
